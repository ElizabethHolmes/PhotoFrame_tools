# PhotoFrame_tools
## About
PhotoFrame_tools is a package of Java programs for editing and selecting images for display in digital photo frame. 

** PLEASE NOTE: The programs in PhotoFrame tools are some of my first programs written as a beginner Java programmer and so I apologise if the code is inelegant, unconventional or otherwise sub-optimal; they work for the intended purpose and I provide them in case they might be useful to others, but with no guarantees. **

## Requirements
Both programs in PhotoFrame_tools require a Java Runtime Environment.
